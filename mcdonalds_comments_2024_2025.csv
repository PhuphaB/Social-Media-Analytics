This is a one-time exception to the no politics rules since it's such a big news story, there's lots of misinformation about it, and folks are really upset at McDonald's.

[McDonald's didn't give Trump permission to serve fries.](https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/21/business/mcdonalds-trump-visit-statement/index.html)

> The company said Sunday in an internal memo to employees obtained by CNN that it did not invite Trump or the attention the election has brought it -- but the company spun the spotlight as proof that McDonald's remains a key part of everyday American life for millions of people.

> . 

> The company clarified in its memo that Derek Giacomantonio, the franchise's owner and operator, was approached by local law enforcement about Trump's desire to visit and Giacomantonio accepted.

This will be the  first and only post about Trump's McDonald's stunt. 

McDonald's didn't approved  it. It was done at a franchisee-owned small town (Feasterville, PA) McD's, so aim your anger at the franchisee. 

It was all done at a closed McDonald's. So The Donald never worked at a real open McD's.

It's a McDonald's franchise. He went there, met the staff, put on an apron, fried some food, and handed it to everyday Americans. 

Yes the site was closed and locked down. And yes I'm sure those people in their cars were vetted first.

But what else did people expect? The man's a former US President and the favorite to again become President in a few weeks.

Were they expecting him to just turn up at a fully open and accessible McDonald's and whip around the kitchen serving food? And then allow any random person to drive up to him, in a car, about 1 foot away from him. Do they have any idea how much of a security risk that is?! He's already been shot once! 

It's all PR. As you said, they're all up to it. All that matters is gaining votes.

McDonald's customers are cutting back on fries. Its biggest supplier is cutting jobs,"Your overall point stands, that they *can* sell them cheaper. 

As far as the app goes, outside of the fact that one is trading their personal data for pennies on the dollar, the app is only good for certain situations. If all one wants is fries, sure they're usually available at a discount via the app. 

That said, not *all* app deals are available *everywhere*. App deals vary by region, in some cases not even the same deals are available in the same state. Just because a deal is available in Ohio that does *not* mean it's guaranteed to be available in Arizona. 

App deals are also limited to *one* “deal” per 60 minute visit. So say if one wanted to use *two* deals, they'd have to wait an hour between uses to be able to do that, which is not realistic for a visit to McDonalds. 

Also, if one is taking family or friends with them, most deals are useless as most deals (not all) are for a single item or a specific order only. In the end, there may be nominal savings via a deal on the app, but nothing that negates McDonald's or their franchisee's skyrocketing price increases. It's just greed all the way around.",2,10/10/2024 19:00

For a while in the US we had the Buttermilk Chicken Tenders but I would say these were different than Chicken Selects. Not quite as good in my view but still really tasty - sadly they took these off the menu during the pandemic.

In Canada, all we have are Chicken McNuggets. Which is really sad to me considering the difference in quality between a McNugget and a Chicken Select. It is as if someone in McD Corporate wanted to see how good of a chicken nugget product they can produce when they put their minds to it, and they got the Chicken Selects.

Not even close. I tried the ""Sausage, Bacon & Egg"" one and it's mediocre. The sauce is bad.

They just decided to randomly jack it up despite being a wildly successful and established business with the means full well to keep prices at least semi reasonable.

Mc Donalds was great when a Mc Double was a $1 - $1.50 range. A Big Mac was around $4. Now you're charging me $3.50 for a Mc Double and $6.50 for a Big Mac. 

I'm in the mid west. There are so many other burger joints around me. My go to is Culvers. Fresh burgers with real ingredients. For the same price, I get way better burger at Culvers. Same can be said for places like Subway compared to Jersey Mike's. 

I don't know why places like Mc Donalds and Subway think they can price their food as restaurant quality when people only really went there cause it was cheap.

McDonald's Is Finally Bringing the Chicken Big Mac to the US,"For one year, during one Big Mac event. Not at one point.

During a Big Mac Event McDonald's introduced three new Big Mac. The Big Mac Jr, which was a cheeseburger made up like a Big Mac, then two new special 1/3lb burgers. I don't recall their names, but one had a single patty and one had two patties.

They double patty burger was more meat than the regular Big Mac. 

They harkened back to the old, old Big Macs, but still bigger. Technically speaking these were even bigger than a Quarter Pounder. The patty was larger as was the bun.

In later years, they brought back the original Double Big Mac, which was double the cheese and double the meat. However, it was the only sandwich.",3,9/1/2024 16:42
McDonald's Is Finally Bringing the Chicken Big Mac to the US,"No, they haven't. The Big Mac has remained the same for 30-40 years. The only change may have been a reduction from two slices of cheese to one back in the mid 2010s.

A more recent change has been to the bun, but the meat for the Big Mac has been 1/10 regular beef patty for decades.

The bun got bigger because testing showed a larger, fluffier bun kept the sandwiches warmer longer without drying them out.",4,9/1/2024 16:47

McDonald's Is Finally Bringing the Chicken Big Mac to the US,The single best thing they ever created in corporate. Perfect size and everything. Not full with a quarter pounder but a double quarter is too much food. It was the perfect in between with amazing taste.,1,9/15/2024 5:06
McDonald's Is Finally Bringing the Chicken Big Mac to the US,"In context, yes there was. Portion size wise, the burgers eaten today are huge. A single quarter pound burger for many people would have been enough for almost an entire days meal, if it was available. Back when ithe Big Mac was introduced, the regular meat patty was 1/8th of a pound. Today, it's 1/10th of a pound. So, a Big Mac would have been more meat, more bun, and overall more calories than a single hamburger or cheeseburger, or even a Double Cheeseburger.

Calorie wise, the Big Mac is still one of the largest burgers. Compared to a single Quarter Pounder with Cheese, a Big Mac has almost the same amount of calories, but less protein.

In today's world, it isn't rare for a tiny twig of a girl or woman to come into McDonald's and order a Double Quarter Pounder meal, for herself, let alone men. Just a burger alone represents nearly all the calories recommended in one day for men or women, not counting the fries and the drink.

So, I context, eating habits and caloric intake changed, but the Big Mac is still a big sandwich.",3,9/3/2024 11:44

What was free in a meal for $10 is now being sold for $40 and up depending on the design. It's a shame. Even the workers were looking at codes on the bottom and taking them to resell or keep. Why they didn't just mass produce them enough so people could actually collect them is beyond me. Can't collect something if you get the same cup multiple times in a row because they have only one box of the same cup to give out. They just didn't make enough of them,2,8/20/2024 20:08

Got talking with a manager at one of the McD's near me while doing a partial refund for my meal, she told me they had people ""try""  to order 75+ meals ""in one go"" just to get the cups...

McDonald's extends $5 meal deal at most US outlets into August -- The $5 meal has helped bring back traffic into McDonald's restaurants,"It's hard to keep loyal customers these days to begin with for any business, but did McDonald really try? I was in one of the restaurant a few weeks ago, using my 20% off offer on my mobile apps for a Sausage'N Egg McMuffin. After paying on the app, I found out I was charged with the full amount. So I put in an inquiry regarding this with all my transaction info. Two days later, I got reply saying the only eligible item from that offer was for Egg McMuffin. I checked the app again and the eligible items were for Sausage'N Egg, Bacon'N Egg and Egg McMuffin. I took a screenshot and sent it on my reply. Two days later, another reply still insisted the only item eligible was Egg McMuffin, and told me to uninstall and reinstall the app again. I was dumbfounded but what do I know.  I followed their suggestion, uninstalled and reinstalled the app again, open the app and found the same fxxxing result of the offer. All 3 items were eligible for the discount. At that point, I was really pissed. Did their so called “customer service specialist” really did the due diligence to check on my inquiry or just simply took their pick and replied to get that off their back. The 20% off was only less than $1 to begin with. As such a big corporation, do they really know how to deal with simple issues like this. For less than a dollar, they now have a really pissed customer that will never go back and spread their brilliant way to deal with customer. If their app screw up, it's your own problem because they can interpret whatever they want whether you have proof or not.",12,7/23/2024 1:10

also, in the app i often get the deal “spend 2 dollars to get a free medium fry” deal, i can stack that on the 5 dollar deal. after all this, i end up getting 

mcdouble, 4 piece nuggets small fry, medium fry, large drink

Chick Fil A has almost the same revenue (21 billion) as mcdonalds (25 billion) with a fraction of the number of locations (3,000 vs 13,000).

If the MCD is run correctly with good numbers and such the Mcd makes about .50 cents.

As in it's a break even. When cost of ingredients production and franchise etc fees are all paid.

The Franchise I work for has 32 restaurants and they hate it. It makes more traffic yes but without the profit.

Most customers who get the $5 meal then don't make a separate purchase kinda nullifying the whole “get the customer in the door”

Seeing that sparks several emotions -- humor, confusion, disgust.... :)     I've never seen anyone I know shove a flared-open wrapper in their face like that.  Everyone I've ever known takes the sandwich out of the wrapper to eat it, I've never shoved the wrapper into my face... not ever.

Also, I've never eaten while driving... or riding as a passenger.    We usually don't eat in our car at all.   If we can't go inside to eat, we don't eat.

One bag made like 10 side salads or 5 entree salads, and you could sell them for 24 hrs after they were prepped. 

If the r2d2 charts weren't nt accurate you'd run out or have too many left over. 

Prep was literally taking the salad out of the bag and putting it in the container, then layering the sw-blend or bacon bits and cheese.

Burritos are a pain. Especially if you're in a store that sells a lot of them. Takes forever to wrap them all.",7,7/7/2024 12:53

McDonald's Discontinued Its Salad Offerings in America -- Due to Lack of Demand,"It's a cultural difference. Americans usually have to eat on the go. Sitting down to eat dinner is kind of a luxury. We don't do it because we enjoy it 🤣. We are just trying to grab something quick between point A and point B, and it's not unusual to only have a few minutes to do so.

Edit: an example of usual day for people in my economic class. 

7:30 am: drop kids off at daycare
8:00 am- 3pm: work with an unpaid 30 min lunch break.
3:30pm: pick kids up from school and daycare
4-5:30pm: cart them around to activities/sports

Idk their oil, but when I worked at Bojangles, our fryer oil was a mix of liquid oil and beef tallow.  Even the dedicated French fry fryers.  So that would make fries non-vegetarian.  

And then mixing/not cleaning cooking surfaces.  Even with that dedicate French fry fryer, we'd still throw chicken in that if we had a rush.  So now there's cross contamination of meat products (if we weren't counting the beef tallow to begin with).  At McDonald's, are they cooking the impossible burgers on a separate griddle?  Or cleaning it after cooking beef?   Even if a separate griddle is used, is it guaranteed never to cook beef?  Probably not, so it's safer to just stay away and go to places that specialize in this and you know are safe for vegans, rather than a corporation that's doing it for the money grab.",2,6/28/2024 10:22

"The Viral 470-Calorie 'Slimmed Down' McDonald's Order People Are Calling 'Heaven-Sent' -- It's a McDouble with no bun, no ketchup, no mustard, extra shredded lettuce and extra pickles. She adds half a tangy barbecue sauce (45 calories), which she spreads between the two burger patties.","Good tip. Most people perceive bread as being healthy, when in reality it adds a disproportionate amount of calories to most meals. Atkins / Keto are very effective, and one of the most basic ways to cut carbs and lose weight is stop eating bread. But when getting a double meat burger to use as the ""bun"" you should use some napkins first to drain as much fat and grease from the meat as possible. Fat has twice as many calories per gram as carbs or protein, and doesn't really change the flavor as much as you would expect.",2,6/23/2024 17:11

For a long time now it has felt like pure luck if you receive your order actually warm/hot. The quality has dropped significantly, also the drive through seems so badly managed its incomprehensible, the method Mcdonalds  implemented to try and speed up the time it takes a customer to proceed the drive through has been completely side stepped by the franchisees and they simply park everyone up in order to show false numbers to whomever these are reported to. It actually has the reverse intended effect by slowing down the processing as well as causing chaos within the small area traffic has on their grounds.

Honestly if it wasn't for happy meals and playland I doubt we would ever stop in. But they are supposedly going to remodel soon so I assume there will be no more playland before long.",3,5/1/2024 23:46

Yes I will agree that the quality of the food is better but it's still quite a bit more expensive.

McDonald's New Bacon Cajun Ranch McCrispy: A Salty Review Saved By The Sauce,"Honestly the McChicken is better still. The spice is great, though admittedly I was a bit caught off guard because usually any spice in fast food restaurants are... mild, at best. So, that was awesome

Though what's frustrating is that when I ordered the deluxe they didn't give me lettuce and there was like... a SINGLE pickle... which the deluxe isn't supposed to have(I hate pickles), so it ended up being just a chicken between some bread and some sauce.

There's not a lot of crunch or bite to the chicken itself, it's overly soft. Again- McChicken is better. It's soft but you expect it to be and, despite being much cheaper, it's much more tasty.

The sauce didn't really belong with the chicken, I felt? It might have gone better if they had gotten the order even remotely correct. Bit sad about it but I can't drive back right now.",2,4/23/2024 20:49

The recent increase in net profit is mostly due to staffing savings in moving to a drive through centric business which allows for more profit with less employees.  Once automated food prep is more reliable,  there won't be many $20 fast food jobs anymore.",1,4/8/2024 17:09

"McDonald's has doubled its prices since 2014, data shows","I'll take Chick-fil-a over Popeyes 9 times out of 10.

I enjoy Popeyes, really like their fries especially with the blackened ranch, and I think they have one of the best breadings in fast food, but Chick-fil-a is more consistent, and I enjoy their sandwiches more.

Popeyes sandwiches are good...when they're good. I had one of their blackened chicken sandwiches and thought it was the best of any of the fast food chicken sandwiches (even without it being breaded). Haven't gotten one of that quality since. The last three I had I didn't even care to finish.

I also really enjoyed BK's Spicy Ch'King, but they got rid of that for the much worse Royal Crispy Chickens.

So yeah Chick-fil-a, their sandwich is always my go-to if I want a chicken sandwich since I know it isn't going anywhere or changing, plus their waffle fries are really good, even if I mostly use them to shovel their Chick-fil-a sauce into my mouth. That's one of the main reasons I go. (Store bought bottles aren't exact, but they're pretty good. Usually use them for homemade chicken, egg, and cheese breakfast burritos)",3,4/4/2024 5:21

McDonald's to sell Krispy Kreme doughnuts nationwide by the end of 2026,"No, I understood what you were saying. But the reason Krispy Kreme closed it's locations was a decline in business along with an over extension. Sheetz dropping them as a contract was probably a drop in the bucket.

Sheetz is big in PA, but they aren't as big as Speedway.

I personally am not a fan of KKD. All of their donuts are overly sugar-coated.

For McDonald's this will be big though, because when we had the donuts they were probably the best selling baked goods at breakfast followed by the cinnamon buns. The problem is, they were frozen. If these donuts come to McDonald's fresh they will sell like hot cakes every day, and we sell a lot of hot cakes every day.

Don't use the app for a while you'll start getting offers that are more inviting. They call it “tailor made” or “preference driven”, but it's just a way to collect data. While you're using the app they are learning your habits: how often you go, how often you check and if your phone is tracking your location it'll know when you're near competition. Ever get a push notification when in proximity? This is all about squeezing more out of you.

McDonald's says cash-strapped diners are choosing to eat at home more often,I think part of it is how they are changing the business model. They remodeled the local one and made the counter ordering area much much smaller and took out the drink machines. A lot fewer people go in now to sit down and eat.

It's just McDonalds used to be significantly less expensive than other fast food places which was its primary draw. Sure the fries are great, but there are other fast food options, just in the past they weren't as inexpensive as McDonalds. With the two metrics being quality and price, as a whole they presented the best option the consumer when their prices were so low. Now that their prices are comparable to other fast food options you're left with going toe-to-toe on quality alone, which in that battle you're not going to fare as well.",2,3/14/2024 19:52
